###Workflow Organizer Application
Simple RoR application to manage a front page with helpful links to use during the work day. Meant to run on heroku with 1 web dyno so there is no cost on the hoster. 

Current status is prototype so the utility is minimal and very crude. Feature incomplete but the core should is there. 

Use Cases: 

- Adding Site: Use navigation to create a new link with the URL from browser. After the URL has been validated you can select an image that you would like to display on the front page for the given link
- Manage Font Page: Change the positioning of the links on the homepage, delete links, modify links all from the home page using the 'Edit Frontpage' Button

TODO:
- Lots of feature enhancements to make the prototype into an alpha.
- Apply a real styling that doesn't look so hilariously horrid
- Enhance Site Management to include add site without having to leave the front page
